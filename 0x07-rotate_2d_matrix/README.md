# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

This project is about rotating an `n x n` 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise
in-place.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.8.10
- No external libraries can be imported
- The solution must be done in-place
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` standards
- All files must be executable

## Files:
- `0-rotate_2d_matrix.py`: Implements the matrix rotation function
- `main_0.py`: Test file for running the rotation
